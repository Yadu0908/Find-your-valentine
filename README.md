## 🎯 What's This?

Tired of fake promises from dating apps? This Valentine finder tells you the **brutal truth** - stop wasting time on romance and focus on your goals!

It's a fun, satirical web app that "scans the universe" for your perfect match, only to tell you what you already knew deep down: **ABE PADHAI LIKHAI KARO, IAS-YAS BANO!** 📚

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Beautiful Glass Morphism UI** - Pink vibes with smooth animations
- 💝 **Floating Hearts** - Because even rejections deserve to look good
- 📊 **Real-time Compatibility Scan** - Spoiler: It's always ∞ (infinitely single)
- 🎭 **Gender-specific Roasts** - Personalized motivation for bros and sisters
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** - Works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- 🚀 **No External Dependencies** - Built-in SVG icons, pure React magic

## 🎬 How It Works

1. Enter your name (we won't judge... much)
2. Pick your date of birth (age is just a number, right?)
3. Select your gender
4. Adjust your "desperation level" (1-10 scale of how down bad you are)
5. Click "Start Valentine Scan" ✨
6. Watch as the app dramatically calculates your compatibility...
7. Get the reality check you needed: **Focus on your career!**
